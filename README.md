# This is how i created my DevBoard:

## Starting my project and doing the first few steps

First I created a schematic for my new project in which i am following the tutorial. 

After I did that I placed down a few capacitors. Then came the USB Connector which took a little bit longer but all of this took only like 3 hours with reading the tutorial and researching about capacitors.

Until now i mostly understood everything i did but i think it will still get more complicated. Next I will be doing the crystal oscillator.

## Added crystal oscillator and flash memory + some research

I added a crystal oscillator to my dev board. Which I found interesting that a little vibrating crystal keeps everything working in order. I than also added a little flash memory for storage. This isnt very much literally 16mb. I then did some research to inform myself about resistors and the RP2040 (and logic gates as a side quest).

## Completed schematic and assigned all footprints

I labeled and connected all of the pins to the "I/O Headers", this took a long time although you can copy paste them. After that I assigned all footprints as shown in the tutorial. I think this was the shortest part in my project.

## Designing the PCB

Wow this took an absolutely long time with all the connecting and placement. Then there was the error fixing that took really long because i had to do so much research and writing in the support channel on slack. The worst thing was moving the parts to better positions because of all the clearance violations.

## Exporting the design and adding it to JLCPCB

Ok first of all i had so many issues with this part. The tutorial was made on an older version of KiCad so it took a bit figuring out how to export the files. I than successfully exported the files but some parts were missing so i had to put them manually into the spreadsheet. But in the end after some YT tutorials i got it. Now i order it upload the receipt and wait for approval.
